Late.js - With-logic templates with JavaScript

Project was created on requirement to move away from jQuery templates and enable [Content Security Policy](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/content-security-policy/). Code is originally based on [mustache](http://mustache.github.com/), but since has been heavily changed to incorporate if statements, else clauses and robust function calls.
